# Streak App

This app provides both simple and complex features, enabling users to create and manage their goals using a streak system.

## Goals

* Enabling people to create streak instances.
* Providing notifications.
* Free and open-source use.
* Optional ads to help financially support website and app hosting.

## Streak Instance

A streak instance is a streak model where you can build a list of tasks using fancy and interactive blocks.

### Blocks

Currently, I am planning to add the following blocks:

* **Text Block:**
    * Just text with a "Next" button below.
* **Clock Block:**
    * Text with a built-in timer showing the remaining time. Skip and "Next" buttons.
* **Count Block:**
    * Text with a built-in counting screen where you can count using "+" and "-" buttons. Skip and "Next" buttons.

### Building

Building, as I said, will be possible using blocks. Their design will be similar to those from the Scratch program: [https://scratch.mit.edu/](https://scratch.mit.edu/).
